title: Data Lab - Homelessness Analysis – U.S. Treasury
excerpt: The U.S. Treasury’s Data Lab presents an analysis showing where people experience homelessness across America and the federal programs to assist them. 
header: On a single night in 2016, more than 500,000 people experienced homelessness in the United States.
description: Multiple federal, state, and local programs offer support to people experiencing homelessness. Our visualizations display federal financial data to show the breakdown of funding spent to address homelessness.

				Care grantees to use multiple approaches to complete their count, if necessary. Grantees may use a
				census approach, a sampling approach, or a combination of the methods.<span class='superscript'>3</span>

	title="Federal programs that address homelessness"
	body="<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development plays a lead role in federal efforts to
					address homelessness, although multiple federal agencies manage programs that provide
					services including education, employment, housing resources, and more.</p>
        <p>Our analysis identified 33 federal programs that explicitly flagged homeless individuals
					as beneficiaries. These included programs that named homeless individuals as primary
					targets of services or as one of the program's target recipient groups.<span class='superscript'>4</span> We found that
					programs targeting homelessness focus either on all individuals experiencing homelessness,
					or on a subset, such as veterans or youth. These programs provide various types of assistance,
					which we divided into six categories: housing, food, education, employment, health, and support
					services.</p>
			  <p>Federal funding is just one piece of the puzzle - states, municipalities, and other organizations
					play a large role in providing funding to address homelessness. While we did not conduct a comprehensive
					analysis of the relationship between federal, state, local, and private funding sources for programs that
					alleviate homelessness across the country, numerous examples show that federal funding works as part of a
					larger network of support.</p>
			  <p>For example, the city of New York spent $1.6 billion on homelessness programs in 2017,<span class='superscript'>5</span> compared with
					about $250 million from federal programs (including those where homeless individuals are one of several
					beneficiaries).</p>
			  <p>The city of San Francisco spent $275 million on similar programs in 2017,<span class='superscript'>6</span> compared to the $63 million
					they received in federal funding.<span class='superscript'>7</span> </p>
			  <p>And, to cite an example of private funding, the Church of Latter Day Saints has given $42 million (over
					the last ten years) to build housing in Salt Lake City.<span class='superscript'>8</span></p>
				<hr>
				<p><span class='superscript'>4</span> As an example, we included a program managed by the Department of Health and Human Services called <i>Grants for New and Expanded Services under the Health Center Program</i>, which provides funding for expanded and sustained national investment in health centers, even though people experiencing homelessness were one type of beneficiary listed, along with migrant workers, public housing residents, and others. We did not include programs intended to address poverty or that provide resources for low-income individuals if homeless individuals were not specifically mentioned as a type of beneficiary.</p>

It may be helpful for those working in the field to know what types of funding their neighbors are receiving and to know what regions are similar to their own regardless of location. Using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, we clustered Continuum of Care areas based on a variety of attributes, such as population, income, and the prevalence of mental illness."

	body="As these visualizations depict, thousands of people are homeless across the United States. 
	We hope that this analysis show how federal funding impacts homelessness and can serve as a useful tool for state and local governments, 
	as well as private institutions, who are working to reduce homelessness. 
	In addition, we chose to conduct this analysis because it features data from across multiple federal agencies, 
	which is all available in one dataset. <br /><br />
	Analysts and users who have ideas for other types of analyses, whether featuring contracts or financial assistance across the federal government,
